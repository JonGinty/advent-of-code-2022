# Advent of Code 2022

A collection of my submissions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022.

All solutions (so far) are built using TypeScript (in strict mode) and run / tested using [Deno](https://deno.land/)

Please don't judge me based on code quality here, these are all wacky-hacky quick solutions which I did not refactor after completing the challenges.

## Examples
### Run
- run normally ```deno run ./src/01/index.ts```
- run without file read prompt ```deno run ./src/01/index.ts```

### Test
- ```deno test ./src/01/```
